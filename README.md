# DD-CSS
---------
## Data-driven Computational Social Science

DD-CSS is an effort to build new computational tools to help collect and analyze social media data.
It is built on Flask, a highly modular microframework for Python, to encourage other developers to contribute to this project.

There is a growing interest in mining the social web by so many professions for different purposes.
So, while many parties may benefit from DD-CSS, our primary target is computational social scientists.
We would like you to import your collection & analysis methods into DD-CSS especially if you are publishing in [social computing conferences](http://www.mli.gmu.edu/toz/wordpress/2014/05/26/social-computing-conferences/).
