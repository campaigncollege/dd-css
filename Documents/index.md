#About DD-CSS
---
DD-CSS is an open source web application to help researchers collect data from social media platforms such as Twitter, and analyze them.
It is powered by Flask, a highly modular microframework for Python.
DD-CSS is initiated by [Talha Oz][toz].

##Motivation

###Need
There is a growing interest in mining the social web by so many professions for different purposes.
Do you know of any web application that facilitates collection and analysis of social media data?
I don't; this is how this project started.
I indeed knew about several tools for social network analysis such as Gephi, Pajek and UCINET ([here][SNA-tools] is a list), however these applications mostly address issues such as the calculation of the network metrics and the visualizion of networks.
Also they don't have data importer plugins that can directly pull data from social media.
NodeXL is the only one that I know of but it only works in MS Excel on MS Windows; also it is heavily focused on network clustering, although there are many kinds of analysis on social media other than clustering.

###Collaboration
Computational social science is an inter-disciplinary field. Some researchers are strong in computation and programming while others are much more knowledgable about social science theories and methodologies.
Successful research requires both skills.
We look forward researchers with programming skills to contribute to this project to collaborate, and to help others by allowing them to use your scientific tools.

###Reproducibility
Many computational social scientists develop algorithms for analyzing the data on social media, implement them and publish their findings in conferences such as ICWSM and WWW ([here][CSS-conferences] is another list).
That would be great if there was a platform where they submit their codes for others to reproduce their experiments.

##Your Contribution

Are you interested in our application?
Would you like to contribute but do not know how to?
Good. Because, you can contribute to this project in many ways.
